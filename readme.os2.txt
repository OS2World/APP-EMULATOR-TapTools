This is the OS/2 port of TAP Tools 1.0.2.

These are programs made to fiddle with the .TAP files used
by ZX Spectrum emulators like RealSpectrum, Z80 and many
others (so many I just can't count 'em).

Now that we have FUSE 0.10 (thanks to Paul Smedley), together
with many Java ZX Spectrum emulators, I think
these little pieces of software might come in handy, so I
got together some packages and recompiled 'em for OS/2, using
GCC 3.3.5 and the Build Enviroment made by Paul Smedley.

If you find these programs useful, weird or funny, please let
me know. And please consider donating to Paul Smedley, whose
hard work makes it possible to keep our system up to date with
many important programs.
